In this Master Degree project me and my team had to find a way to optimize and automize the lightning-system of a chemistry-lab of the Politecnico di Milano.
Here the task way to identify the best parameters (bulding temperature, automated-curtains settings etc.) in order to find the optima and cut costs.
Here no ML model is involved and prediction were hard-coded
